  - **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** represents a data security technique that ensures the encrypted status of data through mathematical confirmation, offering an unprecedented degree of assurance about the storage and handling of data. In contrast to conventional encryption methods that only safeguard data during storage or transmission, requiring decryption for computations, analyses, or utilization in machine learning models, FHE stands out. The need for decryption often places the data at risk of being accessed by skilled opponents or inadvertently leaked. However, FHE permits computations to be executed on the encrypted data itself, creating an equilibrium between maximizing the use of sensitive data and minimizing the chance of unauthorized disclosure.
