# About Me



Hi! My name is **Weihang Tan**. I am a **postdoctoral research associate** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, under the supervision of Dr. Keshab K. Parhi. I received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA, in 2018, 2020, and 2022, respectively, where I worked under the guidance of Dr. Yingjie Lao. 

My research interests include hardware security and VLSI architecture design for <font color=Blue>fully homomorphic encryption</font>,  <font color=Blue>post-quantum cryptography</font>, and <font color=Blue>digital signal processing systems</font>.
